        <h2>About the Dish</h2>
        <p>Meet the lasagna that whispers instead of shouts. In this Lasagna Béchamel, paper-thin pasta is tucked between a savory, tomato-bright ragù and clouds of velvety béchamel scented with nutmeg. 
           As it bakes, the layers relax into one another, the edges turn delicately crisp, and a bronzed blanket of Parmigiano emerges on top.
           It’s rich without being heavy, elegant without being fussy—the kind of comfort food you serve with a simple green salad, a glass of red, and a satisfied silence at the table.</p>
         <p>Each bite tells a tale of time and tradition—the béchamel gently blankets the meat like snowfall over a rustic hillside, tempering the richness of the ragù with its creamy grace. 
            The pasta sheets, barely thicker than parchment, hold everything together like pages in a handwritten recipe passed down generations. When you cut into it, steam escapes like a sigh of relief, revealing layers that didn’t just cook—they became something new entirely. 
            It’s the kind of dish that makes a Sunday feel sacred.</p>

        <h2>Cooking Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Make the Ragù (Meat Sauce)</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large pan, heat olive oil over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Add chopped onion, carrot, and celery. Cook until soft (about 5–7 minutes).</li>
                <li>Stir in garlic and cook for 30 seconds.</li>
                <li>Add ground meat. Cook until browned, breaking it up with your spoon.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>Stir in tomato paste and cook for a minute to deepen the flavor.</li>
                <li>Add wine. Let it simmer until it mostly evaporates (2–3 mins).</li>
                <li>Add crushed tomatoes and a splash of milk (if using). Simmer uncovered for 25–30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste and adjust seasoning.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Make the Béchamel Sauce</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a medium saucepan, melt butter over medium heat.</li>
                <li>Whisk in flour. Cook while stirring for 1–2 minutes (don’t let it brown).</li>
                <li>Slowly add warm milk, a bit at a time, whisking constantly to prevent lumps.</li>
                <li>Cook until it thickens to a creamy sauce (about 5–7 minutes).</li>
                <li>Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Preheat the Oven</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Set your oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Assemble the Lasagna</li>
            <p>In a greased 9x13 baking dish:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread a small layer of béchamel at the bottom.</li>
                <li>Add a layer of pasta sheets.</li>
                <li>Spoon over some ragù, then some béchamel, then a sprinkle of Parmesan.</li>
                <li>Repeat layers (pasta → ragù → béchamel → cheese) until you’re near the top.</li>
                <li>Finish with béchamel and a good layer of Parmesan (add mozzarella if you’re into it).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake It</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover with foil and bake for 25 minutes</li>
                <li>Remove foil and bake uncovered for another 15–20 minutes until golden and bubbly.</li>
                <li>Let it rest for 10–15 minutes before cutting. (Trust—it sets up beautifully.)</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
